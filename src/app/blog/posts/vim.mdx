------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive ranking systems are a core part of multiplayer gaming, providing players with a sense of progress, accomplishment, and competitive challenge. Inspired by Valorant’s ranking ladder, this project introduces a twist on traditional Elo systems: a **risk-based rating system** where players can earn higher rewards by teaming with lower-ranked players. This adds a layer of strategic decision-making long before the match even begins.

This article explains how the system works and how it aims to make ranked progression more dynamic and engaging.

## Dynamic Elo Rating System

Traditional Elo systems typically assign predictable win and loss point values. This system takes the concept further:

* Higher-ranked players **gain more Elo for winning alongside weaker teammates**.
* Losing to lower-ranked opponents results in **greater Elo penalties**.
* The system calculates difficulty based on team averages and rank gaps.

This ensures that every match outcome is meaningful and that taking on harder challenges carries the potential for bigger payoff.

## Leaderboard System

The real-time leaderboard showcases:

* Player names
* Ranks
* Current Elo scores

After each match, scores are recalculated and reflected instantly. This creates a transparent, constantly shifting competitive environment where each game matters.

## Rank-Based Matchmaking

Players are not restricted to narrow rank brackets. Instead:

* Matches can be formed even when teammates have noticeable rank differences
* Higher risk means **higher reward potential**
* Matchmaking uses team Elo averages to evaluate difficulty

This flexibility encourages a more open matchmaking experience similar to Valorant, but enhanced through mathematical scaling.

## Ranking Tiers

The ranking system mirrors Valorant’s competitive structure:

* Iron
* Bronze
* Silver
* Gold
* Platinum
* Diamond
* Ascended
* Immortal
* Radiant

As players progress upward, the difficulty—and potential reward—scales alongside.

## How It Works

1. Players queue solo or in a group.
2. The matchmaking system evaluates relative skill using rank and Elo.
3. A match takes place.
4. Elo changes are calculated based on:

   * Rank difference
   * Team average Elo
   * *(Optional)* individual performance stats
5. The leaderboard updates in real time.

Players who take greater risks can rise faster—if they win.

## Technologies Used

This system is built with a modern full-stack architecture:

* **Frontend:** React for interface and leaderboard display
* **Backend:** Flask for matchmaking logic, Elo calculation, and APIs
* **Database:** MongoDB for storing player profiles, match results, and rank history

## Installation & Setup

### Backend (Flask)

```
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Frontend (React)

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Database (MongoDB)

Use a local instance or cloud provider such as MongoDB Atlas.
Set your MongoDB connection string in the `.env` file.

## Future Improvements

Possible next steps include:

* More advanced matchmaking algorithms
* Elo adjustments tied to individual performance
* Seasonal leaderboards and rank resets
* Discord integration for matchmaking and community play

## Conclusion

This project aims to make ranked play more exciting, rewarding, and strategic. By tying Elo gains to the level of risk players take in matchmaking, the system encourages bold decisions and adds depth beyond just in-game performance.

Whether players climb slowly and safely or make daring high-risk queues, the leaderboard u
