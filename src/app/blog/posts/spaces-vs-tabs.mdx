The Outfit Idea Generator is a unique application designed to help users discover stylish and personalized outfit ideas based on their existing wardrobe. By combining user preferences with OpenAI's DALL-E, the tool generates creative outfit suggestions tailored to individual tastes.

## Features

**Wardrobe Input:** Users can upload pictures of their clothes to the application.  
**Outfit Suggestions:** The tool provides initial outfit ideas derived from the uploaded wardrobe.  
**User Feedback Loop:** Users review suggestions and provide feedback:  
- Selecting "Yes" adds the outfit to a favorites list.  
- Selecting "No" discards the outfit.  
**AI Enhancement:** The favorites list is sent to DALL-E to generate new, creative outfit ideas.  
**Continuous Improvement:** The cycle of generating and approving outfits repeats until the user finds a satisfying AI-generated outfit.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Wardrobe:** Users add pictures of their clothing items.  
2. **Initial Suggestions:** The application generates outfit ideas based on the uploaded wardrobe.  
3. **User Feedback:** Users approve or reject outfits:  
   - "Yes": Outfit added to favorites.  
   - "No": Outfit discarded.  
4. **AI Generation:** DALL-E creates new outfits based on the favorites list.  
5. **Final Selection:** The process repeats until a preferred outfit is found.


## Thoughts Throuhgout

**When Building:** Throuhgout the building of this software I came into many issues with the image generation and being able to generate images that related to the initial pictures. I also had bad designs for the UI and the whole process of presenting the image generation and fetching photos to use to get similarities. Overall, it was a fun project to make for a Hackathon, there were many areas to improve upon when I look back on doing this project.
